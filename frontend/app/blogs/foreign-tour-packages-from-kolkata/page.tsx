      <P>
        Foreign destinations hold allure for Indians, including Bengalis, for
        several reasons. Firstly, they offer a break from routine, allowing
        travelers to explore diverse cultures, cuisines, and landscapes.
        Secondly, they provide opportunities for unique experiences not easily
        found domestically, such as visiting iconic landmarks or indulging in
        adventure sports. Additionally, foreign travel symbolizes status and
        prestige, reflecting an individual&apos;s cosmopolitan outlook. For
        Bengalis specifically, there&apos;s a historical connection due to the
        region&apos;s rich literary and intellectual heritage, sparking
        curiosity about other cultures. Moreover, globalization and increased
        disposable incomes have made overseas travel more accessible and
        desirable for many Indians, fostering a culture of exploration. Let’s

        One simply cannot afford to miss out on a visit to a Cheese Farm and a
        Wooden Shoe Workshop in the Netherlands. Exploring the historic streets
        of Rome would surely remind us of our tedious History book pages. One
        cannot leave behind Italy, to marvel at iconic landmarks like the
        Colosseum and Vatican City. Savoring a croissant and coffee at a quaint
        Parisian café while admiring the Eiffel Tower&apos;s grandeur is a must.
        Embarking on a scenic train journey through the Swiss Alps, taking in
        breathtaking vistas of snow-capped peaks and picturesque villages is
        another highlight. Cruising along the canals of Venice, Italy, in a
        traditional gondola, soaking in the romantic ambiance and architectural
        wonders is something that will remind you of iconic movie scenes from
        various film industries. Watching the sunset over Santorini, Greece,
        from a cliffside perch, painting the sky with hues of orange and pink as
        it dips below the horizon will be the perfect Mediterranean medley. The
        starting price per adult would be around 3.5 lakhs; might further alter
        and depend upon credentials put by clients.
