          Why are sea destinations so lucrative among travelers? Well, firstly,
          they offer a diverse range of attractions, from pristine beaches to
          vibrant marine life, making them appealing to a wide range of
          travelers. Additionally, nearshore destinations often boast luxurious
          resorts and amenities, catering to those seeking relaxation and
          indulgence. Furthermore, maritime activities such as snorkeling, scuba
          diving, and sailing attract adventure enthusiasts, while cultural
          experiences like seafood dining and local festivals appeal to those
          interested in immersing themselves in the local culture.

          Considering the Andaman and Nicobar islands, the natural beauty of the
          blue sea, with its azure waters and picturesque coastlines, also
          serves as a backdrop for romantic getaways and honeymoon vacations.
          How often have we not come across people praising its white sand
          beaches and exotic sea shell collections? Additionally, sea
          destinations like that of Andaman, often have favorable climates,
          offering year-round appeal for tourists seeking to escape cold winters
          or humid summers elsewhere. Andaman has been quite a popular tour
          destination among foreigners as well. Kolkata being closest to Port
          Blair (flight distance covered) sees a surging demand across Andaman
          tour packages. Overall, the combination of natural beauty, diverse
          attractions, and recreational opportunities makes such sea
          destinations highly lucrative in the tourism industry.
